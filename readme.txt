osCommerce for WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin is to be used with WP.osC (released under GNU/GPL by Roya Khosravi).

WP.osC (osCommerce for WordPress) is a modified version of osCommerce, one of the most popular ecommerce solutions. The main difference between WP.osC and osCommerce, is that WP.osC uses the same Theme system as WordPress. 

WP.osC allows you to integrate osCommerce into an existing Wordpress website. 

You need to install WP.osC package before using this plugin.

Plugin Features:

1. Displays on your WordPress blog's post/page:
- New products 
- Random products 
- Top 10 Best Sellers 

2. Adds a dynamic widget in your blog’s sidebar to display:
- New products 
- Random products 

Usage: You have three options:

- Create a page or post and enter one of the following tags anywhere in the content.

[wposc:new] Displays new products.<br>
[wposc:best] Displays top 10 best sellers.<br>
[wposc:rand] Displays random products.<br>

- The plugin adds two widgets to display new products and random products, so you can place these widgets on your sidebar through Design=>Widgets.

- If your theme doesn't use widgets, you can use one of the following functions in your sidebar:

display_new_products(); and display_random_products();
